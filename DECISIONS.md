### D1 (BUILD_1/1.2) — Where the N+1 fix lives, and the "bounded" threshold

**Decision.** Add `select_related`/`prefetch_related` at the point that owns the
queryset for each list path: in the **view** when the view builds it inline
(reviews, goals, org, feedback), in the **service** when a service function
returns it (jd `search_jds`, career `list_roadmaps`). The budget guard
(`ScalingResult.is_bounded`) treats an endpoint as bounded when extra rows add
`≤ max(2, extra_rows//4)` queries — i.e. a small constant, not one-per-row.

**Options considered.** (a) one central `.select_related` mixin on pagination —
rejected: the FK set differs per serializer and a blanket join risks pulling
unused tables; (b) `prefetch_related` everywhere — rejected: a forward FK is
cheaper as a JOIN (`select_related`); prefetch is reserved for the one reverse
relation (goals→kpis). (c) per-row caching — rejected: doesn't fix the query.

**Why safe.** Output bytes are identical (only query count changes); no scope,
tenant, or RBAC predicate is touched; the feedback fix select_relates only
`subject` (givers are never on that serializer), so anonymity is unaffected.
Verified by the 6 app suites (354) + the budget module.

### D2 (BUILD_1/1.3) — Two targeted indexes; aggregation left in Python (no-win)

**Indexes ADDED (each serves a real, identified hot query — not speculative):**
- `ix_review_tenant_recent` = `(tenant, -created_at)` on Review. Serves the
  default paginated list for the broad scopes (Manager/HRBP/Admin):
  `WHERE tenant=? ORDER BY -created_at LIMIT page` — eliminates a filesort over
  the full tenant set. Employee-scope filtering is already covered by the
  `(tenant, employee, cycle)` unique-constraint index.
- `ix_goal_emp_recent` = `(tenant, employee, -created_at)` on Goal. Serves the
  hottest Goal read — an employee's own goals / a manager's team goals
  (`WHERE tenant=? AND employee[_id in …] ORDER BY -created_at`). The only
  pre-existing index was `(tenant, cycle, employee)` (cycle-leading), which
  cannot serve an employee filter; this is the only employee-leading index.

Both migrations apply AND reverse cleanly; DDL verified (`… created_at DESC`).

**Considered and REJECTED (honesty — not every audit item yields a change):**
- `.only()`/`.defer()` on list serializers: reviews intentionally serialize
  `draft_body`/`final_body`; JD bodies live on `JDVersion`, not the list row;
  remaining text columns are small. No measurable win, real risk of breaking a
  serializer field. Left alone.
- Push analytics aggregation into the DB (`Avg`, `GROUP BY`): rejected as a
  net-negative. `department_analytics` and `calibration_grid` already
  materialise their result set exactly once (the individual rows are part of the
  output), and MySQL 8 has no clean median aggregate — a DB rollup would add a
  second query, not remove one. The Python aggregation runs over already-fetched
  rows, so it is the optimal shape.
- `person_card`: added `select_related("manager")` (saves one round-trip on a
  hot detail endpoint; covered by existing org tests).
